# StartupScript

A simple batch script to open programs when you start your computer

## How to use

- Create an empty folder anywhere on your (Windows) computer and place the script in the folder
- Add shortcuts to the programs you wish to start in the folder
- Create a shortcut to the startup script in the Windows startup folder

You can modify the shortcuts to e.g. start the program as an administrator or add commands to the "target" dialog.

To open a webpage in Chrome you can create a shortcut to chrome.exe and change to target to *"C:\Path\To\chrome.exe" http://mywebpagecom*.

Why is this better than putting all the shortcuts in the startup folder? Because you get the dialog with the option to cancel the startup script within 10 seconds if you for some reason don't want to start all the programs.
